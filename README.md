# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


# Basic React Project

This project is a fundamental application built to expand my knowledge and revise the core concepts of React. It serves as a practical exercise in understanding basic React principles.

### Key Concepts Practiced:
- Component-based architecture
- Props and state management
- JSX syntax
- Handling user input and events

This project helped me solidify my foundational skills in building user interfaces with React, and I look forward to applying these skills to more complex projects.
